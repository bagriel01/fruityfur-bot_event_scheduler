📨 */FFPost*
    Use this command to schedule an event post.
    There are two ways to use it:

    • Reply to the event message in the group with /FFPost — the bot will contact you via DM to finish the process;
    • Forward the event message directly to the bot's DM.

    In the DM, the bot will ask for the event date and time in the format MM/DD/YYYY \\- HH:MM and send the post for approval.

📅 */FFThisMonth*
    Displays this month's published events.

🗑️ */FFRemove*
    Reply to the original event message with this command to remove it from the channel and the schedule.

⛔️ */cancel*
    Cancels the current operation.

🏓 */FFPing*
    Checks whether the bot is online and displays the current version.

🔐 */FFPrivacy*
    Displays the bot's privacy policy.

⚠️ *Notes:*
    • /FFPost only works in groups — or by forwarding an event directly to the bot's DM.
    • /FFThisMonth can be used by group administrators or by any user in the bot's DM.
    • Only group administrators may use group management commands.
